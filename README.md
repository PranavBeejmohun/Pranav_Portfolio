Data Portfolio

[Project 1 : Stock Analysis](https://github.com/PranavBeejmohun/Pranav_Portfolio)

Stock Market Analysis means analyzing the current and historical trends in the stock market to make future buying and selling decisions. Stock market analysis is one of the best use cases of Data Science in finance. This is why it is my first Data Science project.
